    <h1>Visiting Belize</h1>
    <p>In January of 2018 I started making plans to vacation abroad. 
        The past year had been a "life changing" 
        year for me and I needed time away from Kansas City, work, family, friend etc. 
        I decided what I needed most was
        a <strong>BEACH</strong> to regroup, reconnect, recooperate and relax!!  
    </p>
    <p>While deciding where to visit I asked a friend, who's visited Belize several times, 
        if Belize would be safe for
        me to go alone. 
        He assured me it was safe as long as I kept my wits about me but he also added
        he was traveling in April and he would be happy to have me join him.  
        Within 20 mins <em>I my flight was booked!</em>
    </p>

    <h2>First Impressions of Belize</h2>

        <p><img src="./images/belize-sign.jpg" alt="Colorful Belize Sign" height="300" 
            width="350" align="left">
            
        After securing the rental car my friend proceeded to show me around Belize City, 
        the capital of Belize.  Our first stop
        the colorful Belize sign.  Of course, you can't visit a country and not take the 
        absolute, most touristy photo! </p>

        <p>There were two things I noticed immediately about Belize: </p>
            <ol>

               <li>There are no traffic lights in the entire country!  None, nada, not one! 
           There are round-abouts and <em>extremely large</em> speed bumps which keep the 
           traffic in check.</li>  <br>

               <li> I discovered this little tidbit later in the day.  
                   Belize does not have <strong>ANY</strong> fast food
           restaurants! Again, NONE, NADA, NOT ONE.  No Mickey D's, Taco Bell, or
            Burger King, etc. </li>
           </ol>
           
          <p> This came as a delightful surprise! Being from the US where 
           there's a fast food joint 
           on every corner.  
        </p>

    <h2>The Drive to Placencia</h2>

            Placencia is a small village 3 hours drive south of Belize City.  
            During the drive you wind through the Belizian capital of Belmopan, then on
            through the mountainious country-side.  Eventually, arriving at the tip of a 
            beautiful penninsula and the village of Placencia.

        <p>This picture was taken after my first morning sunrise in Placencia!
           My hotel room was located across from this cafe directly on the beach.  
           It was heaven!</p>
