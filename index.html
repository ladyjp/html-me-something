        width="350" align="left">In January of 2018 I started making plans to vacation abroad. 
        The past year had been a "life changing" 
        year for me and I needed time away from Kansas City, work, family, friend etc. 
        I decided what I needed most was
        a <strong>BEACH</strong> to regroup, reconnect, recooperate and relax!!  
    </p>
    <p>To help me in deciding where to visit, I asked a friend, who has visited Belize several times, 
        if Belize would be safe for
        me to go alone. 
        He assured me it was safe as long as I kept my wits about me. He also added that
        he would be traveling to the Central American country in April and he would be happy to have me join him.  
        Within 20 mins <em>I my flight was booked!</em>

    <h2>First Impressions of Belize</h2>
   
    <!--add padding around image in CSS-->
    
        <p><img src="./images/belize-sign.jpg" alt="Colorful Belize Sign" height="300" 
            width="350" align="left">
            
        After securing the rental car my friend proceeded to show me around Belize City, 
        the capital of Belize.  Our first stop
        the colorful Belize sign.  Of course, you can't visit a country and not take the 
        absolute, most touristy photo! </p>

        <p>There were two things I noticed immediately about Belize: </p>
            <ol>

               <li>There are no traffic lights in the entire country!  None, nada, not one! 
           There are round-abouts and <em>extremely large</em> speed bumps which keep the 
           traffic in check.</li>  <br>

               <li> I discovered this little tidbit later in the day.  
                   Belize does not have <strong>ANY</strong> fast food
           restaurants! Again, NONE, NADA, NOT ONE.  No Mickey D's, Taco Bell, or
            Burger King, etc. </li>
           </ol>
           
          <p> This came as a delightful surprise! Being from the US where 
           there's a fast food joint 
           on every corner.  
        </p>

    <h2>The Drive to Placencia</h2>
        
        <p><img src="./images/thedrive.jpg" alt="Drive to Placencia" height="300" 
            width="350" align="left">
            
            Placencia is a small village 3 hours drive south of Belize City.  
            During the drive you wind through the Belizian capital of Belmopan, then on
            through the mountainious country-side.  Eventually, arriving at the tip of a 
            beautiful penninsula and the village of Placencia.

        <p>This picture was taken after my first morning sunrise in Placencia!
           My hotel room was just steps from the beach.  It was heaven!</p>
